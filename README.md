1/4/2021 - Final Update before archive.

This project is nowhere near complete, but for now I'm going to archive it.
I started it in MAR 2020 when COVID shutdowns started as a personal project for my friends.

In June I stopped working on this to work on a GUI version that uses the qt framework.
I am much prouder of the GUI version of this product. It is much more planned out, documented, and MUCH cleaner. (Still being developed).

Because of this, I have both no motivation and no reason to continue adding to this specific repo.

To future me, I'm proud of you for having a goal and sticking to it.

Thanks for reading.
